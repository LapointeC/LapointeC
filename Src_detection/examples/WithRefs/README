1. Define the refs. 

The purpose is to build the references it means covariance matrix for each from a sequence of 
directories with some specifications.

custom true/false

directory
  label
  name
  format   poscar, cfg, data, xyz, dump, mixed
  id_atoms   1,3,129     1-20,30-50     all         
  model       MAHA, MCD, GMM 2-4


auto   true/false:
--------------------------------

MCD    true/false  (default is MCD true)
---
contaminations
nb_selected

GMM    true/false
---
SK options:
no of modes 4

HOME_MADE options:
nb_selected


OUTPUT: PKL
label: MCD, GMM_01, ..., label_01, label_02, ...
dim(d) = dim(label)
 


2. Inspect the model


3. Define the model
